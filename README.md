Certainly! 
Let's break down the `WYSECONNECT` contract in detail, focusing on its purpose, functionality, and key components. 

This explanation will cover the contract's design, interfaces, state variables, functions, and their interactions.

### Overview

The `WYSECONNECT` contract is an ERC20 token with additional features, including trading, fee management, and liquidity handling. It interacts with Uniswap (or similar DEX) to manage liquidity and fees. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### Key Components

1. **Interfaces**
   - **`IUniswapV2Factory`**: Provides the `createPair` function to create trading pairs.
   - **`IUniswapV2Router01`**: Provides functions for adding liquidity and interacting with the router.
   - **`IUniswapV2Router02`**: Extends `IUniswapV2Router01` with the `swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens` function for token-to-ETH swaps.
   - **`IERC20`**: Standard ERC20 interface including functions for transferring tokens, checking balances, and allowances.
   - **`IERC20Metadata`**: Extends `IERC20` with additional metadata functions like `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals`.

2. **Libraries**
   - **`Address`**: Provides a helper function `sendValue` for safely transferring ETH.

3. **Abstract Contracts**
   - **`Context`**: Provides functions to retrieve the sender and data of the transaction.
   - **`Ownable`**: Manages ownership and access control. Only the owner can execute specific functions.

4. **ERC20 Token Implementation**
   - **`ERC20`**: Implements the ERC20 standard with minting, burning, and allowance management.

### `WYSECONNECT` Contract

**Constructor**
- **Initial Setup**:
  - Sets the router and creates a pair with the corresponding Uniswap V2 factory based on the network (BSC Mainnet/Testnet or ETH Mainnet/Testnet).
  - Mints a total supply of 100 billion tokens to the owner’s address.
  - Sets initial fee values for buying, selling, and transferring tokens.
  - Configures the fee receiver address and sets up fee exclusions.

**State Variables**
- **`tradingEnabled`**: Indicates whether trading is allowed.
- **`uniswapV2Router`**: Router for interacting with the Uniswap exchange.
- **`uniswapV2Pair`**: Address of the trading pair created.
- **`_isExcludedFromFees`**: Mapping to check if an address is excluded from fees.
- **`feeOnBuy`, `feeOnSell`, `feeOnTransfer`**: Fee percentages for buying, selling, and transferring tokens.
- **`maxBuyFee`, `maxSellFee`, `totalFeeLimit`**: Limits on fee percentages.
- **`feeReceiver`**: Address to receive collected fees.
- **`swapTokensAtAmount`**: Minimum token amount required to trigger a swap.
- **`swapping`**: Prevents re-entrancy during swaps.
- **`swapEnabled`**: Toggles swapping functionality.

**Functions**
1. **`constructor()`**
   - Sets up the Uniswap router and trading pair based on the network.
   - Initializes token properties and fee settings.
   - Mints tokens and sets initial exclusions.

2. **`receive()`**
   - A fallback function to receive ETH/BNB directly.

3. **`creator()`**
   - Returns a string (project URL or similar).

4. **`claimStuckTokens(address token)`**
   - Allows the owner to retrieve tokens accidentally sent to the contract, excluding its own tokens.
   - If the `token` address is zero, it retrieves BNB.

5. **`claimStuckBNB()`**
   - Allows the owner to claim BNB stuck in the contract.

6. **`excludeFromFees(address account, bool excluded)`**
   - Sets or removes fee exclusions for specified addresses.

7. **`isExcludedFromFees(address account)`**
   - Checks if an address is excluded from fees.

8. **`changeFeeReceiver(address _feeReceiver)`**
   - Updates the address where collected fees are sent.

9. **`enableTrading()`**
   - Enables trading and swap functionality.

10. **`setSwapTokensAtAmount(uint256 newAmount, bool _swapEnabled)`**
    - Sets the minimum token amount required to trigger a swap and toggles swapping.

11. **`setBuyFee(uint256 newBuyFee)`**
    - Updates the buy fee percentage, ensuring it doesn’t exceed limits.

12. **`setSellFee(uint256 newSellFee)`**
    - Updates the sell fee percentage, ensuring it doesn’t exceed limits.

13. **`adjustFees(uint256 newBuyFee, uint256 newSellFee)`**
    - Adjusts both buy and sell fees at once, ensuring they comply with set limits.

14. **`_transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount)`**
    - Handles token transfers with fee calculations and swapping logic. If swapping conditions are met, it performs a swap and sends fees to the designated receiver.

15. **`swapAndSendFee(uint256 tokenAmount)`**
    - Swaps tokens for ETH using the Uniswap router and sends the ETH to the fee receiver.

16. **`burn(uint256 amount)`**
    - Allows the owner to burn tokens from their own balance.

17. **`burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount)`**
    - Allows the owner to burn tokens from a specified account, provided they have sufficient allowance.

### Summary

The `WYSECONNECT` contract is an ERC20 token with advanced features including fee management, trading, and liquidity handling via Uniswap. It allows the owner to control fees, manage liquidity, and handle stuck tokens. 
It’s designed to interact with decentralized exchanges for trading and liquidity provision, ensuring that trading is enabled only when specific conditions are met.
